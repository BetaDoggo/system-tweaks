# system-tweaks
An ongoing collection of tweaks for my personal system, mostly assembled from forums.

# Rotation
Some screen rotation scripts for manual rotation. iio-sensor-proxy and other automatic rotation features should be disabled
# touchfix.sh
Sometimes my touchscreen breaks, I use this to disable it
# usbfix.sh
One of my usb ports broke and it was causing issues so I toggle the module when needed. Best to set this to a keybind.
